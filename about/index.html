                Background Information
            </h2>
            <p class="center">
                The United States Militia (USM) was originally created under the name "North Carolina Militia" (NCM). We made this change when the map changed from being in Great Lakeside, NC to Rockford, IL to keep the name universal no matter what map the server is using. 
                <br><br>
                NCM was created in late November, 2021 in a merge of 3 families - Purgatory Outlaws (POL), Weyland-Yutani Corporation (WYC), and The Phantom Association (TPA). The creation of NCM resulted in gaining over 20 members, including new members who wanted to take part in the fun. This strong family lead to an alliance to take on a rival family with the help of an alliance with Umbrella Corporation (UMC) and the Brotherhood of Steel (BOS) which ended in victory. We are still allied with these families to this date.
